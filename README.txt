Description: This program counts the number of times a word appears in a file or when typed via keyboard and displays the results
as a histogram and alphabetically sorted word list with accompanying frequency totals.

Limitation: 100 unique words it the maximum this program can work with. Words more than 14 letters will mess up alignment

Instructions: Navigate to the correct file folder.
	1. Compile and link by typing: make
	2. Run by typing: ./"Modified WordCounter"
		a. While program is running, type words (hit enter after each word) and then ctrl + d when finished
		   (to signify end of input).


Note: to use file input instead of keyboard. Type the following:
	./"Modified WordCounter" < TestData.txt		<--TestData.txt can be any filename along with its extension (.txt,.cpp, etc.)
